Conversational UIs: Talking to Siri, Alexa, and Your Web Browser

A typical user experience these days moves seamlessly between smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even smart TVs without us even thinking about it. Google calls this our new "Multi-Screen World". Netflix, Amazon Prime, Facebook, and Twitter are examples of services that we use on a daily basis that flow like water across all of the glass screens in our life.

But what if there is no screen? What if your User Interface is talking to your wrist, or talking to thin air as you walk into a room? Gartner predicts that 30% of all interactions with computers will be done with your voice by 2018.

In this talk, Scott Davis (author/presenter of the O'Reilly video series "Architecture of the MEAN Stack") helps break down what Conversational UIs are, and how you can adopt them in your application. As we explore real world examples and APIs that you can begin using today, you'll quickly learn that calling this "Artificial Intelligence" is a bit premature. But it's still pretty darn cool, and something you should be paying attention to today...
