# web-speech-api
A repository for demos illustrating features of the Web Speech API. See [Web_Speech_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for more details.

## Speech color changer demo
[Run recognition demo live](http://mdn.github.io/web-speech-api/speech-color-changer/)

Tap the screen then say a colour — the grammar string contains a large number of HTML keywords to choose from, although we've removed most of the multiple word colors to remove ambiguity. We did keep goldenrod, cos, well.

This current works only on Chrome/Chrome Mobile. To get this code running successfully, you'll need to run the code through a web server (localhost will work.)

## Phrase matcher demo
The same comments as above apply to this demo too — this is another demo that relies on speech recognition, written for a research team at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.
